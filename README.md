Semantic Adaptation in Preschoolers Project 


Ex. 1 is a norming study to assess the a priori expectations of 4-5-year-olds about the semantic thresholds of "some" vs "many." 23 4-5 participants say whether a speaker should use "some" or "many" when describing proportions of 4/10, 5/10, 6/10, and 7/10. We found that children exhibit the same pattern as adults (e.g., they expect "some" until around 50% then they expect "many").

Ex. 2 and Ex. 3 look at whether 4-5-year-olds will update their expectations after being exposed to a speaker who is biased to use either "some" or "many" to describe proportions of 50%. (Ex. 3 is a replication of Ex. 2 with the questions pre-recorded rather than asked by the experimenter). 

Ex. 4 looks at whether they can update their expectations for two speakers at the same time (one who is many-biased and one who is some-biased). They do initially, but the effect is not long-lasting (e.g., they answer correctly during the first trial block but incorrectly during the second trial block).
